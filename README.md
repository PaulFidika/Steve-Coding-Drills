My father, Steven Fidka, died on 08-11-2022.

Back in the 90's, my dad used to work mostly in DOS, programming business logic in COBOL at Bassett Mechanical; he did their payroll systems, password management, running sales reports, etc. A bunch of custom command-line software he created.

My dad was an inspiration for me to get into coding at an early age; he provided me with a computer and internet connection (AOL 56k dial up back in the 90's).

After his passing, I decided to begin doing daily coding drills, as practice. The first thing I do when I wake up is spend 15 minutes trying to build something random. It doesn't really matter what, and it doesn't really matter if it works or not; the point is to get better, faster, stronger.

I feel like most of my time is normally spent in massive codebases, and that causes you to forget the fundamentals; i.e., you forget how you even setup your dev environment in the first place, or you forget how to write basic syntax from scratch because you're so used to copy-pasting it from another function in another file that acts as a template for you.

Anyway, we'll see how this goes.
